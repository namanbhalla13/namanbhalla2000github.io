	<div class="father"><bold><center>SANJAY BHALLA</center></bold>My father is like a friend to me. He loves me at all times. He teaches me all the values and morals I must live by. And he himself lives by all the values. He believes in practicing what he preaches. So I find my father very honest. And he never finds it difficult to be that way.



</div><div class="mother"><bold><center>PRAMILA BHALLA</center></bold>A mother is the person who plays most important role in every one’s life. No one can take place of her. Being a mother is the best feeling a woman can have ever in her whole life. Mother is the one who can do her best for giving her child each and every comfort. At different stages, a child tries to learn life’s lessons under his or her mother’s guidance. Mother’s love for her child is beyond any one’s expectations. Mother can easily identify each desire of her child even when her child is not able to speak properly.

<div class="dadi"><bold><center>VIMALA BHALLA</center></bold>My grandmother is quite an old lady. She has already crossed sixty. Her years have now bent her back a little but have not affected her activities. She is tall and thin. She is gray haired and her humble and affectionate face is full of wrinkles. Her eye-sight, however, is quite good and she can read without spectacles.


She is a religious lady. But her devotion to religion and God does not disturb rest of the family. She is the first to leave her bed in the morning. Before we get up, she has already taken her bath with fresh water. Immediately after bath, she goes to the nearby temple. We eagerly wait for her to come back, for she brings sweets for us</div>
	<div class="aunty"><bold><center>KSHAMA BHALLA</center></bold>Not everybody is lucky to have sisters, but I am. I have a little sister. She is Pranky, naughty, stubborn, short-tempered, at the same time, humorous, loving and caring. She truly is one of a kind and I love her a lot.</div></div>
